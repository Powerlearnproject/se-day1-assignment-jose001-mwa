A Version Control System (VCS) helps developers track changes to code, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if needed. It manages modifications to source code over time, ensuring changes are documented and recoverable.  
 Types of VCS
- Centralized VCS (CVCS) – A single server stores all version history (e.g., Subversion, Perforce).  
- Distributed VCS (DVCS)*/– Each developer has a full copy of the codebase, enabling offline work (e.g., Git, Mercurial).  

Importance of VCS  
1.Facilitates Collaboration– Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.  
2. Provides History Tracking– Every change is recorded, making it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary.  
3. Enhances Code Security – Prevents accidental loss of code by maintaining backups in repositories.  
4.Supports Parallel Development – Developers can create branches to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.  
5. Enables Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Automates testing and deployment processes in DevOps workflows.  

Examples of VCS 
- Git – The most popular distributed VCS, used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.  
- Apache Subversion (SVN)– A centralized VCS used in enterprise environments.  
- Mercurial – Similar to Git but designed for simplicity and performance.  

 
IDEs streamline development with essential tools like debugging, syntax highlighting, and integration features while VCS ensures safe and efficient collaboration, tracking code changes and preventing data loss.
